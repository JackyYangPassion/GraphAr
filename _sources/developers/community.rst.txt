We welcome participation from everyone and encourage you to join us, ask questions, and get involved.

All participation in the GraphAr project is governed by the `GraphAr Code of Conduct`_.

Questions?

Mailing list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `GraphAr mailing list`_ is for discussion of GraphAr development and usage.

Send an email to `graphar+subscribe@googlegroups.com <mailto:graphar+subscribe@googlegroups.com>`_
to subscribe to the mailing list.


Tag Convention
"""""""""""""""""
The mailing list follow the convention of prefixing subjects with one or more tags in order to
clarify the scope and purpose of messages. For example:

- [ANNOUNCE] GraphAr 0.1.0 released
- [DISCUSS][C++] How to implement a new API in C++?
- [DISCUSS][Format] How to support partition pruning?
- [Spark][Reader] Support the push-down of filters

When emailing to the mail list, please prefix the subject line with one or more tags.
Depending the topic of your email, tags may include one or more:

- Supported Environments: e.g., [C++], [Spark], [Java], etc.
- Specifications: e.g., [Format], [Reader], [Writer], [API], etc.

You may also prefix your subject line with [DISCUSS] if your email is intended to prompt a discussion
rather than get an answer to a specific question.

Slack

If you are not used to communicate with mailing list, you can also join the
`GraphAr Slack`_ to chat with other GraphAr users and developers.

GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues as a way to ask questions and engage with the GraphAr developer community
and for maintaining a queue of development work and as the public record of work on the project.
We use the mailing list for development discussions, where a lengthy discussions is required.

We host online meetings to provide spaces for synchronous discussions about the GraphAr project.
These discussions usually focus on topics of interest to developers who are contributing to GraphAr,
but we welcome users of GraphAr to join.
